* SELECT OPERATIONS
*/

// Select all entries from all fields in table
SELECT * FROM table;
// Select distinct entries from field in table
SELECT DISTINCT field FROM table;
// Count entries from table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table;
// Count unique instances of field in table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT field) from table;

/*
* QUERY OPERATIONS
*/

// Query entries using logical operators
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'string'; // Equal to string
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field <> 'string'; // Not equal to string
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field < number; // Less than number
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field > number; // Greater than number

// Query entries using like operation
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field LIKE 'string%'; // The % wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field LIKE 'string_ab'; // The _ wildcard will match preceding chars eg 'ab'

// Query entries for multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field > 1994 AND field < 2000;

// Query entries for multiple conditions under the OR condition
SELECT * FROM table WHERE (field_a > 1994 AND field_a <= 1996)
AND (field_b = 'string_a' OR field_b = 'string_b');

// Query entries between condition values
SELECT * FROM table WHERE (field BETWEEN 1 AND 5);

// Query entries with multiple OR conditions using IN
SELECT * FROM table WHERE (field IN (1,2,3,4));

// Query entries that contain null values
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field IS NOT NULL;

/*
* Aggregate Operations
*/

// Get Average (mean) value of field
SELECT AVG(field) FROM table;

// Get Max (also can use MIN) value of field
SELECT MAX(field) FROM table;

// Get Sum value from field
SELECT SUM(field) FROM table;

/*
* Aliasing
*/

// Alias columns using AS
SELECT MAX(field) AS max_field, MAX(field) AS max_field FROM table;

// Aggregate functions and aliasing to calculate a percentage
SELECT ((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE field IS NULL) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage
FROM table;

/*
* ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING
*/

// Order field (string) alphabetically
SELECT field FROM table ORDER BY field;

// Order field (numeric) high to low
SELECT field FROM table ORDER BY field DESC;

// Group by field, and perform count on field labels
SELECT field, count(*) FROM table GROUP BY field;

// Group and order by to get max values
SELECT year, country, MAX(budget) FROM table GROUP BY year, country ORDER BY year, country;

// Group by a field_a that has (HAVING) a count of field_b over 10
SELECT field_a FROM table GROUP BY field_a HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
